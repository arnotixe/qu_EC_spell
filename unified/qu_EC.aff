# VERBS
#
# are funny things.
#
# Let's try twofold suffix stripping to deal with the great flexibility of the Quichua verbs.
# There are [at least] two major branches of verbs, "common" and "pluralized"
#
# 1) The common conjugations are tagged with /v:
#   mikuna//v
#
# The tag /v gives "mood/direction/style" to the verb:
# miku|RA|na/c ; miku|CHI|na/c ; miku|CHIRA|na/c and so on. This is the first level.
# 
# The tag /c gives time+sex to the verb:
# miku|ra|NKI/+ ; miku|chi|RKANKI/+ ; miku|chira|RKANKICHIK/+ and so on. This is the second level (and hunspell's max for the moment).
#
# 2) The pluralizing inflex -na- is causing trouble because it comes BEFORE the "/v" tag suffixes, 
#      and is not compatible with all the "/c" variants.
#    The -na- means something like "do the verb amongst many"
#
# e.g. tanta|na|ku|nchik : -na- comes before ku, the "/v" variant, and nchik, the "/c" variant.
# e.g. tanta|na|ku|sha   : -na- comes before ku, the "/v" variant, and sha is incompatible with -na-
#
# So since the tags run the show linearly: "/v" -implies> "/c" -implies> "/+", 
#  all the variants under /v must be repeated under "/w". 
# Then we can repeat only the valid -na- combinations from "/c" to the new tag "/p".
#
# The tag /w gives "mood/direction/style" to the verb just like /v, but points to /p tag instead, and keeps the -na-:
# tantana|RA|na/p ; tantana|CHI|na/p ; tantana|CHIRA|na/p and so on. This is the first level.
#
# The tag /p gives time+sex to the verb, valid -na- combinations only:
# tantana|ku|NCHIK/+ ; tantana|chi|CHUN/+ ; tantana|CHIKU|nchik/+ and so on. This is the second level.
#
# -------------------------------------------
#
# The + is not a morph but a compound flag, to indicate that
#   miku|chira|RKANKICHIK/pash/chari  is an OK word, pash and chari being compounds.
#


# COMPOUNDS
#
# The order of the compounds could be checked with a grammar checker. 
# Hunspell does not allow repetition of compound words, so that helps a bit.
# (e.g.) mikuna/chari/chari is NOT ok.
